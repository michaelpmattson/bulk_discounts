# When I visit my bulk discounts index
# Then I see a link to create a new discount
# When I click this link
# Then I am taken to a new page where I see a form to add a new bulk discount
# When I fill in the form with valid data
# Then I am redirected back to the bulk discount index
# And I see my new bulk discount listed
