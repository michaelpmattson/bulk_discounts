## General Info

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

Bulk Discounts is a solo extension of the project featuring added functionality fo merchants to create, edit, and delete bulk discounts for their items.

## Learning Goals
- Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
- Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
- Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
- Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
- Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
- Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
